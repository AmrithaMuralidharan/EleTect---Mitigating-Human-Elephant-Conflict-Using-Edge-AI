Introduction

<img width="584" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b3768e9-0758-4859-8eb0-c0033813d4c9" />

 
Communities in Kerala that live close to forest boundaries are seriously threatened by conflicts between humans and elephants. Tragic events that result in death, wild elephants have destroyed families and uprooted livelihoods. The number of human casualties were 3930 during an eight-year period which requires immediate response. "EleTect, " our endeavor, uses technology to facilitate early detection. At the margins of forests, nodes with TinyML capabilities keep watch and swiftly notify authorities. Our inventiveness doesn't stop there, though. We use the sound elephants naturally dread, the drone of honey bees as a harmless deterrent. "EleTect" seeks to alter the narrative by encouraging safer coexistence, reducing conflicts, and supporting conservation efforts—one in which people and elephants coexist together
Problem Statement

<img width="740" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe8af1a-7ff6-4d33-8b6a-e87cf3d75366" />

 
Kerala, a state known for its lush forests and diverse wildlife, has faced a growing hazard :Human- Elephant Conflicts. Tragic incidents involving wild elephants turning deadly have occurred in areas such as Wayanad, Mananthavady, Munnar, and Idukki. An angry elephant crushed a tribal woman who was collecting honey in the wild. A man in Mananthavady lost his life as a result of a tusker breaking into a residential area. In the same way, another guy was attacked by an elephant on the Kannimala estate, which is close to Munnar. And an elephant in the Idukki district killed a 70-year-old woman. These tragic occurrences highlight how urgent it is to develop workable answers. With an emphasis on early detection, deterrents, and communication, the "Eletect" project seeks to protect lives, foster coexistence, and make a positive contribution to wildlife conservation. "Eletect" uses technology to identify elephants early in order to lessen the impact of these conflicts. Despite their majesty and strength, elephants have a startling weakness: they are afraid of some noises. The sound of bees buzzing is the most noticeable among them. The sound of bees is a surefire way for these gentle giants, despite their great strength, to become wary and even retreat. We may use this amazing natural occurrence to our advantage and the benefit of elephants as well as people. Using this knowledge in the "Eletect" project to develop a long-term resolution to conflicts between people and elephants. We carefully use honey bee noise to discourage elephants from approaching residential areas where people live. As a harmless deterrent, the buzzing noise guides elephants away without endangering them. It's a peaceful strategy that honors both species. At the boundaries of forests, nodes with TinyML capabilities are placed in a thoughtful way. Elephants are deterred and conflicts avoided by using deterrents like playing honey bees noises. Costeffective warnings are ensured through the use of LoRa or LoRaWAN technologies to promote communication between nodes and central systems. The project aims to reduce conflict, support conservation efforts, and encourage a safer cohabitation between humans and elephants. Scalability guarantees that the solution may be successfully implemented in various locations, safeguarding both human life and natural environments.


Solution Overview

<img width="740" height="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3d91c2e-cb06-46c8-b04b-beacd8ce2faf" />

 
By integrating the Seeed Studio Grove Vision AI V2 module and Xiao ESP32S3 Sense within the same enclosure, equipped with a speaker for emitting deterrent sounds, we've created a comprehensive system for elephant detection and mitigation. The Grove Vision AI V2 module runs a vision-based TinyML model using the onboard camera to detect elephants, while the ESP32S3 Sense employs a sound-based TinyML model to detect elephant presence through surrounding sounds. This combination not only ensures multiple layers of detection but also allows for real-time decision-making without relying on external servers, thanks to TinyML's efficiency and autonomy. Furthermore, by harnessing solar power for all components, the system becomes self-sustainable, making it ideal for deployment in remote areas. The use of TinyML on low-power IoT devices not only minimizes energy consumption but also facilitates rapid response to detected events, such as activating deterrent measures like playing honeybee sounds to prevent elephants from entering human habitats. This holistic approach addresses the challenges of human-elephant conflicts by offering a sustainable, efficient, and effective solution.

<img width="740" height="365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9f9e683-b935-403f-bcf5-1220c0fc8f81" />

 
This is how we planned to deploy the project.We will be having multiple nodes in the elephant attack prone area which wil spot the elephant and produce deterrent sounds and also a master to which all the nodes will send the information through LoRa and The master willsend alert to the locals when an elephant is spotted near them and aslo will send all of the collected data to the base station from where we can monitor everything and study about the elephant behaviours and track the pattern of elephant sighting which can be used to improve the projects accuracy and make the life of those who are affected safer.
Some studies shows that elephants are afraid of bee sounds, so we decided to use it as the deterrent sound.

🌿 Field Survey, Government Approval & Real-World Testing
To ensure that EleTect truly addresses on-ground challenges of human-elephant conflict (HEC), we conducted an extensive community survey and received official clearance for field testing from the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Kothamangalam, Mr. Varun Dalia IFS, and Forest Range Officer, Mr. Jaleel.
🧭 Survey & Study Area
Our field study focused on Kothamangalam and Kottapady, two regions of Kerala severely affected by elephant incursions. These locations lie at the foothills of the Western Ghats, close to dense forests — making them high-risk zones for HEC incidents.
Using household surveys, we collected firsthand data from residents to understand the real impact of conflicts. Out of 100 houses surveyed, 85 reported direct elephant attacks on residential or agricultural areas. Major losses identified included:
•	Crop damage: Reported by 66% of respondents
•	Injury or death of people: Reported by 38.4% of respondents
These alarming numbers reinforced the urgency of deploying a technological mitigation solution like EleTect.

🏛️ Official Approval & Collaboration
We formally presented EleTect to the DFO office, Kothamangalam, and the Forest Range Office, discussing both its safety and community benefits. After technical evaluation, the forest department approved live field trials of the system within designated buffer zones around Kothamangalam and Kottapady.

<img width="530" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba49ed2-4612-4312-9c6e-c00d34b01178" />

The department’s involvement ensured ethical deployment — protecting both wildlife and local communities — and validated EleTect as a practical conservation technology.
🌍 Field Testing & Early Results
Following approval, EleTect prototypes were installed along forest boundaries where elephant movement was frequent. Each node combined vision + audio TinyML with LoRa connectivity to relay detections in real time.
 
 <img width="501" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aee2a8a-952d-48a5-813e-ac6e523f9f77" />

Initial trials showed promising outcomes:
•	Locals reported fewer night-time elephant entries after installation.
•	Forest officers received consistent detection logs and LoRa alerts.
•	The bee-buzz deterrent effectively turned elephants away without harm.
The positive community feedback and official validation confirm that EleTect can be scaled safely for real-world conservation use.

<img width="740" height="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/544e10d6-61bd-4ae8-917e-586a957a3df6" />

 
Label each bounding box as elephant.
Use the ">" button to move through your dataset, repeating the annotation process for each image.
Step 4: Review and Edit Annotations
It's essential to ensure annotations are accurate.
Review each image to make sure the bounding boxes are correctly drawn and labeled. If you find any mistakes, select the annotation to adjust the bounding box or change the label.

Step 5: Generating and Exporting the Dataset
Once all images are annotated. In Annotate click the Add x images to Dataset button in the top right corner.
Then click the Add Images button at the bottom of the new pop-up window.

<img width="740" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec1b3f3-9cd2-4e9d-94c4-3824cc5f9035" />

 
Click Generate in the left toolbar and click Continue in the third Preprocessing step.

<img width="569" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e95c499-ef50-4e75-96ac-a886b11b2845" />

 
In the Augmentation in step 4, select Mosaic, which increases generalisation.
<img width="600" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0149f26-2d53-40ed-87ad-90f1b1e00b37" />

In the final Create step, please calculate the number of images reasonably according to Roboflow's boost; in general, the more images you have, the longer it takes to train the model. However, the more pictures you have will not necessarily make the model more accurate, it mainly depends on whether the dataset is good enough or not.

<img width="740" height="425" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4423ba-f207-4d52-9c85-663183a0a278" />

 
Click on Create to create a version of your dataset. Roboflow will process the images and annotations, creating a versioned dataset. After the dataset is generated, click Export Dataset. Choose the COCO format that matches the requirements of the model you'll be training.

 <img width="740" height="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/824b2869-76f0-4454-b13e-0e435601185d" />

Click on Continue and you'll then get the Raw URL for this model. Keep it, we'll use the link in the model training step a bit later.

<img width="740" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a9726b6-9f09-42c9-90b9-db44045d7931" />

 
Congratulations! You have successfully used Roboflow to upload, annotate, and export a dataset for elephant detection model. With your dataset ready, you can proceed to train a machine learning model using platforms like Google Colab.

Training Dataset Exported Model 
Step 1. Access the Colab Notebook
You can find different kinds of model Google Colab code files on the SenseCraft Model Assistant's Wiki. If you don't know which code you should choose, you can choose any one of them, depending on the class of your model (object detection or image classification). https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ModelAssistant_Introduce_Quick_Start/#model-training

<img width="740" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c118d027-6c17-49d1-b37c-007bfbcbcc60" />

 
If you are not already signed into your Google account, please sign in to access the full functionalities of Google Colab.
Click on "Connect" to allocate resources for your Colab session.

<img width="472" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97c1f92f-38ee-46c9-818f-3c5700be52ff" />

 
select the panel showing RAM and Disk

 <img width="508" height="422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/765fc4d2-1262-47ec-a8d6-4ef39628ce60" />

select "Change runtime type"

<img width="625" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d0e189b-5bb0-4b03-b736-0973b21352f0" />

 
Select "T4 GPU"

 <img width="740" height="307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eec253b3-c244-47ae-9d39-8b6624d584ba" />

Now run the "Setup SSCMA"

<img width="740" height="345" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b72cddac-fcc8-4355-b0c4-e095f40e2663" />

 
you will get a warning like this click on "Run anyways"

<img width="740" height="321" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02a1e658-a0a3-4653-b4ed-c6deefe5b71b" />

 
Wait untill the repositary is fully clonedand installed all the dependencies.

<img width="740" height="306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78da2375-2ee2-446b-a67b-044deb60519c" />

 
now its finished

<img width="740" height="65" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b52d7e-23be-4b78-a4ff-b1c1808c5584" />

 
Now run the "download the pretrain model weights file

<img width="740" height="73" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02f54b9a-794d-4ac1-a6bc-1845a17215b1" />

 
Step 2. Add your Roboflow Dataset
Before officially running the code block step-by-step, we need to modify the code's content so that the code can use the dataset we prepared. We have to provide a URL to download the dataset directly into the Colab filesystem.

<img width="740" height="72" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef409b63-6899-45a3-9712-c8308a847990" />

 
To customize this code for your own model link from Roboflow:
1)Replace Gesture_Detection_Swift-YOLO_192 with the desired directory name where you want to store your dataset.
2)Replace the Roboflow dataset URL (https://universe.roboflow.com/ds/xaMM3ZTeWy?key=5bznPZyI0t)
with the link to your exported dataset (It's the Raw URL we got in the last step in Labelled Datasets). Make sure to include the key parameter if required for access.
3)Adjust the output filename in the wget command if necessary
(-O your_directory/your_filename.zip).4)Make sure the output directory in the unzip command matches the directory you created and the filename matches the one you set in the wget command.
 
 <img width="740" height="384" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54350944-1401-4dcc-9b80-c8cd5b000951" />

Step 3. Adjustment of model parameters
The next step is to adjust the input parameters of the model. Please jump to the Train a model with SSCMA section and you will see the following code snippet.

<img width="740" height="219" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f589300-1ab6-436a-a115-1bc6461a3528" />

 
This command is used to start the training process of a machine learning model, specifically a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, using the SSCMA (Seeed Studio SenseCraft Model Assistant) framework.
To customize this command for your own training, you would:
1)Replace configs/swift_yolo/swift_yolo_tiny_1xb16_300e_coco.py with the path to your own configuration file if you have a custom one.2)Change work_dir to the directory where you want your training outputs to be saved.3)Update num_classes to match the number of classes in your own dataset. It depends on the number of tags you have, for example rock, paper, scissors should be three tags.4)Adjust epochs to the desired number of training epochs for your model. Recommended values are between 50 and 100.5)Set height and width to match the dimensions of the input images for your model.6)Change data_root to point to the root directory of your dataset.7)If you have a different pre-trained model file, update the load_from path accordingly.

<img width="740" height="305" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a70ff84e-f1ff-468c-b40d-f72e9d4a25a7" />

 
Step 5. Exportthe model
After training, you can export the model to the format for deployment. SSCMA supports exporting to ONNX, and TensorFlow Lite at present

<img width="740" height="187" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/024070c0-2acd-4aba-bf41-ef2c79b839ee" />

 
Step 6. Evaluate the model
When you get to the Evaluate the model section, you have the option of executing the Evaluate the TFLite INT8 model code block.

<img width="518" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efb987d6-87c5-433a-8808-d93273f73ac1" />

 
Step 7. Download the exported model file
After the Export the model section, you will get the model files in various formats, which will be stored in the Model Assistant folder by default. Our stored directory is EleTect.

 <img width="519" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cb3dd34-997d-4d9f-978b-898f60b503eb" />

select "ModelAssistatnt"

<img width="588" height="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8832e6a6-9c21-4790-8be8-b33b48dcd146" />

 
In the directory above, the .tflite model files are available for XIAO ESP32S3 and Grove Vision AI V2. For Grove Vision AI V2, we prefer to use the vela.tflite files, which are accelerated and have better operator support. And due to the limitation of the device memory size, we recommend you to choose INT8 model.

<img width="740" height="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f04a55-8eb5-46ba-a02e-e7aaf7b15cb9" />

 
After locating the model files, it's essential to promptly download them to your local computer. Google Colab might clear your storage directory if there's prolonged inactivity. With these steps completed, we now have exported model files compatible with Grove Vision AI V2. Next, let's proceed to deploy the model onto the device.

Upload models to Grove Vision V2 via SenseCraft Model Assistant
Please connect the device after selecting Grove Vision AI V2 and then select Upload Custom AI Model at the bottom of the page.

 <img width="740" height="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7325f91-0a12-49a6-a118-2b0776c8741d" />

You will then need to prepare the name of the model, the model file, and the labels. I want to highlight here how this element of the label ID is determined.
If you are using a custom dataset, then you can view the different categories and its order on the Health Check page. Just install the order entered here.
Then click Send Model in the bottom right corner. This may take about 3 to 5 minutes or so. If all goes well, then you can see the results of your model in the Model Name and Preview windows above.
Or you could use the model published by Us.Go to search and in public models search for "EleTect", you can find it.
 
<img width="740" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300979c0-18f1-42d7-a51e-fecdf1a753a6" />

Recording Audio with XIAO ESP32S3 Sense
Let's use the onboard SD Card reader to save.wav audio files, we need to habilitate the XIAO PSRAM first.

 <img width="680" height="307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec0eec7-5327-424b-9138-ef92c3714f9a" />

Insert the microSD card into the microSD card slot. Please note the direction of insertion, the side with the gold finger should face inward.
Then compile and upload the following program to XIAO ESP32S3.

Now, Compile and run the code and get samples of different elephant sounds. You can also capture noise and other sounds. The Serial monitor will prompt you to receive the label to be recorded.
Send the label (for example, Elephant). The program will wait for another command: rec. And the program will start recording new samples every time a command rec is sent. The files will be saved as elephant.1.wav, elephant.2.wav, elephant.3.wav, etc. until a new label (for example, Noice) is sent. In this case, you should send the command rec for each new sample, which will be saved as Noice1.wav, Noice.2.wav, Noice.3.wav, etc. Ultimately, we will get the saved files on the SD card.
send the first label name first, through the serial monitor

<img width="680" height="307" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34a7cee0-4848-4ccc-8d98-9faa0b88cc7b" />

 
Then send command rec and start recording the elephant sounnd using XIAO.

<img width="733" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/945f69ed-fc30-4b54-b54e-68d7870111c9" />

 
Collect both samples in same amount.
Use a card reader to save all the sound samples stored inside the SD card to your computer.

<img width="471" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e7841b9-9d41-40f6-ac35-12c64986bf82" />

 
Training Exported Models with Edge Impulse

<img width="438" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc13781-ec23-4951-b68d-1afe92d51ee8" />

 
We should initiate a new project at Edge Impulse and give it the same name “EleTect”.
Once the project is created, select the Upload Data tool in the Data Acquisition section. Choose the files to be uploaded.

 <img width="740" height="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/231139af-7de8-4c74-85fd-79f44ee63193" />

 <img width="688" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52a72509-84fb-4edd-ac2b-aa4d7730a2da" />

make sure to balance between train and test set.80/20 is the best recommended ratio.
All data on dataset have a 1s length, but the samples recorded in the previous section have 10s and must be split into 1s samples to be compatible. Click on three dots after the sample name and select Split sample.

<img width="740" height="474" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/072a1b40-e1f5-424b-b637-c92ded019c83" />

 
Once inside the tool, split the data into 1-second records. If necessary, add or remove segments. This procedure should be repeated for all samples.
Goto Impulse design
An impulse takes raw data, uses signal processing to extract features, and then uses a learning block to classify new data. First, we will take the data points with a 1-second window, augmenting the data, sliding that window each 500ms. Note that the option zero-pad data is set. This is important to fill with zeros samples smaller than 1 second (in some cases, I reduced the 1000 ms window on the split tool to avoid noises and spikes).

<img width="740" height="471" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4290492b-07e2-42c3-bf8d-d7b725c979e6" />

 
The next step is to create the images to be trained in the next phase. We can keep the default parameter values or take advantage of the DSP Autotuneparameters option, which we will do.

<img width="740" height="453" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4984ba9-4599-4920-9f32-7716cba5f67c" />

 
We will use a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model. The basic architecture is defined with two blocks of Conv1D + MaxPooling (with 8 and 16 neurons, respectively) and a 0.25 Dropout. And on the last layer, after Flattening four neurons, one for each class.

<img width="517" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29297eb8-a40c-4c73-9549-128f88be6f6f" />

 
Edge Impulse will package all the needed libraries, preprocessing functions, and trained models, downloading them to your computer. You should select the option Arduino Library and at the bottom, select Quantized (Int8) and press the button Build. When the Build button is selected, a Zip file will be created and downloaded to your computer.

 <img width="631" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6573b195-7b0f-465a-8730-bdc67fb09d22" />

Before we use the downloaded library, we need to enable the ESP NN Accelerator. For that, you can download a preliminary version from the project GitHub, unzip it, and replace the ESP NN folder with it under: src/edge-impulse-sdk/porting/espressif/ESP-NN, in your Arduino library folder.
Link Address: https://github.com/Mjrovai/XIAO-ESP32S3-Sense/blob/main/ESP-NN.zip
Then you will get the program, compile and run it.

Setting up the DFMini



The DFMini Player module is a small music player. It is low cost and low power and reproduces sounds stored on a memory card.
Based on this, the module can be controlled via the standalone mode, that is, in this mode, there will only be the DFMini module, a battery to power, the speaker, buttons to control it, and the SD card with the songs.
Another way to control it is to use an Arduino or another control device. The Arduino, for example, will send commands through serial communication with the DFMini Player Module.
<img width="450" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3646e291-9222-432f-a57f-330859f74d0e" />


 
To control it, it is important to use the basic standalone circuit
<img width="450" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a479007b-a00f-40ca-ad45-776c6b68a78a" />


 
The two buttons shown in the circuit above are used to change the music tracks and control the volume of the sound.
The button connected to pin IO1 is used to go to the previous track and reduce the volume.
With a quick touch the system returns to the previous song, however, if you press the button for more than 1 second, the system will reduce the volume of the song.
The button connected to pin IO2 is used to go to the next track and increase the volume.
With a quick touch the system advances to the next song, however, if you press the button for more than 1 second, the system will increase the volume of the song.
In this standalone method, the songs must be saved on the memory card
<img width="740" height="358" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61d66b14-bb38-449a-8d3b-c05c3dbffc73" />



 
This way, each time the buttons are pressed, the system will play each song in ascending or descending order.
However, when using Arduino or another control device, we must modify the way of organizing the musical files on the SD Card.
Now, I'll explain how to control the DFMini Player using the Arduino through serial communication.
Controlling the DFMini Player with Arduino
In this step, the volume control, range control, equalization commands and other features will be sent by Arduino.
The Arduino must communicate via the serial with the DFMini Player and send the control commands.

 <img width="450" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f748b6-27b1-4cc5-920c-f593df325b7d" />

First, we must assemble the circuit shown in the Figure below.
After assembling this circuit, you must add the songs on your memory card. In this step, the songs should be renamed as 01, 02, 03, for example.
You cannot leave the songs with their names, as there will be a problem when the Arduino sends the command to execute the specific track. Therefore, you must configure as shown below.

<img width="740" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566f4c4e-3354-4495-bb6f-f215374fbfca" />

 
After naming the files, write the following code on your Arduino.
#include "SoftwareSerial.h"
#include "DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h"
//Inicia a serial por software nos pinos 10 e 11
SoftwareSerial mySoftwareSerial(10, 11); // RX, TX
DFRobotDFPlayerMini myDFPlayer;
char command;
int pausa = 0;
void setup()
{
//Comunicacao serial com o modulo
mySoftwareSerial.begin(9600);
//Inicializa a serial do Arduino
Serial.begin(115200);
//Verifica se o modulo esta respondendo e se o
//cartao SD foi encontrado
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("DFRobot DFPlayer Mini"));
Serial.println(F("Initializing DFPlayer module ... Wait!"));
if (!myDFPlayer.begin(mySoftwareSerial))
{
Serial.println(F("Not initialized:"));
Serial.println(F("1. Check the DFPlayer Mini connections"));
Serial.println(F("2. Insert an SD card"));
while (true);
}
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("DFPlayer Mini module initialized!"));
//Definicoes iniciais
myDFPlayer.setTimeOut(500); //Timeout serial 500ms
myDFPlayer.volume(5); //Volume 5
myDFPlayer.EQ(0); //Equalizacao normal
menu_opcoes();
}
void loop()
{
//Waits for data entry via serial
while (Serial.available() > 0)
{
command = Serial.read();
if ((command >= '1') && (command <= '9'))
{
Serial.print("Music reproduction");
Serial.println(command);
command = command - 48;
myDFPlayer.play(command);
menu_opcoes();
}
//Reproduction
//Stop
if (command == 's')
{
myDFPlayer.stop();
Serial.println("Music Stopped!");
menu_opcoes();
}
//Pausa/Continua a musica
if (command == 'p')
{
pausa = !pausa;
if (pausa == 0)
{
Serial.println("Continue...");
myDFPlayer.start();
}
if (pausa == 1)
{
Serial.println("Music Paused!");
myDFPlayer.pause();
}
menu_opcoes();
}
//Increases volume
if (command == '+')
{
myDFPlayer.volumeUp();
Serial.print("Current volume:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readVolume());
menu_opcoes();
}
if (command == '<')
{
myDFPlayer.previous();
Serial.println("Previous:");
Serial.print("Current track:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readCurrentFileNumber()-1);
menu_opcoes();
}
if (command == '>')
{
myDFPlayer.next();
Serial.println("next:");
Serial.print("Current track:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readCurrentFileNumber()+1);
menu_opcoes();
}
//Decreases volume
if (command == '-')
{
myDFPlayer.volumeDown();
Serial.print("Current Volume:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readVolume());
menu_opcoes();
}
}
}
void menu_opcoes()
{
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("=================================================================================================================================="));
Serial.println(F("Commands:"));
Serial.println(F(" [1-3] To select the MP3 file"));
Serial.println(F(" [s] stopping reproduction"));
Serial.println(F(" [p] pause/continue music"));
Serial.println(F(" [+ or -] increases or decreases the volume"));
Serial.println(F(" [< or >] forwards or backwards the track"));
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("================================================================================================================================="));
}
The code presented above is quite simple and will help you to select the song by its number, stop, pause, control the volume and pass the tracks.
The musical control consists of sending data from the Arduino IDE serial to our Arduino board.
Initially, the system makes the configuration in the setup and checks if the SD Card is inserted in the module. If it is not inserted, the system presents a message to alert the user.
In addition, the system displays messages with system configuration options.
void setup()
{
//Comunicacao serial com o modulo
mySoftwareSerial.begin(9600);
//Inicializa a serial do Arduino
Serial.begin(115200);
//Verifica se o modulo esta respondendo e se o
//cartao SD foi encontrado
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("DFRobot DFPlayer Mini"));
Serial.println(F("Initializing DFPlayer module ... Wait!"));
if (!myDFPlayer.begin(mySoftwareSerial))
{
Serial.println(F("Not initialized:"));
Serial.println(F("1. Check the DFPlayer Mini connections"));
Serial.println(F("2. Insert an SD card"));
while (true);
}
Serial.println();
Serial.println(F("DFPlayer Mini module initialized!"));
//Definicoes iniciais
myDFPlayer.setTimeOut(500); //Timeout serial 500ms
myDFPlayer.volume(5); //Volume 5
myDFPlayer.EQ(0); //Equalizacao normal
menu_opcoes();
}
If the memory card is inserted, the code flow will enter the loop function.
void loop()
{
//Waits for data entry via serial
while (Serial.available() > 0)
{
command = Serial.read();
if ((command >= '1') && (command <= '3'))
{
Serial.print("Music reproduction");
Serial.println(command);
command = command - 48;
myDFPlayer.play(command);
menu_opcoes();
}
//Reproduction
//Stop
if (command == 's')
{
myDFPlayer.stop();
Serial.println("Music Stopped!");
menu_opcoes();
}
//Pausa/Continua a musica
if (command == 'p')
{
pausa = !pausa;
if (pausa == 0)
{
Serial.println("Continue...");
myDFPlayer.start();
}
if (pausa == 1)
{
Serial.println("Music Paused!");
myDFPlayer.pause();
}
menu_opcoes();
}
//Increases volume
if (command == '+')
{
myDFPlayer.volumeUp();
Serial.print("Current volume:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readVolume());
menu_opcoes();
}
if (command == '<')
{
myDFPlayer.previous();
Serial.println("Previous:");
Serial.print("Current track:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readCurrentFileNumber()-1);
menu_opcoes();
}
if (command == '>')
{
myDFPlayer.next();
Serial.println("next:");
Serial.print("Current track:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readCurrentFileNumber()+1);
menu_opcoes();
}
//Decreases volume
if (command == '-')
{
myDFPlayer.volumeDown();
Serial.print("Current Volume:");
Serial.println(myDFPlayer.readVolume());
menu_opcoes();
}
}
}
The user can send the following control characters:
•	Numbers 1 to 3: Select the song to be played;
•	Letter s: Stop the song;
•	Letter p: Pause the song;
•	Send the + sign: Increase the song volume;
•	Send the - signal: Decrease the song volume;
•	Send the signal <: Select the previous song;
•	Send the signal >: Select the next song;
From these signals, letters, and numbers, the Arduino will receive them via the serial and will control the music to be played.
Each condition is presented below and internally, with its respective commands.
if ((command >= '1') && (command <= '3'))
{
Serial.print("Music reproduction");
Serial.println(command);
command = command - 48;
myDFPlayer.play(command);
menu_opcoes();
}

LoRa communication from Nodes to Master
LoRa is a low-power wireless modulation technology that enables devices to communicate over long distances with minimal energy consumption. "P2P" stands for "point-to-point, " meaning devices can communicate directly with each other without the need for intermediate network infrastructure such as base stations or routers.
By leveraging LoRa P2P, IoT devices can communicate directly with each other in environments requiring long-distance communication and low power consumption.
We can connect the Wio-E5 module to the UART socket directly as the below picture shows.

Setting up the Master
 
The master will house the
•	Lora and Antenna
•	SIM800L
•	Arduino mega
•	Power system
The master will collect the data from all of the deployes data and will send alert to the local people when an elephant is spotted near them and will send the data to the base station where we will be able to monitor the data from all the nodes.
Using the SIM800L Module for Alert from Master
 
The SIM800L is a quad-band GPRS module that is a highly integrated module developed with a TCP/IP protocol stack. SIM800L is a small cellular module allowing GPRS communication, sending and receiving SMS, and making and receiving voice calls.
it works on frequencies EGSM 900MHz, DCS 1800MHz, and PCS 1900MHz It supports a GPRS connection with download speeds of up to 85.6kbps. The module has an inbuilt TCP/IP stack that allows it to connect to the internet. The SIM800L also has an inbuilt RTC and can be used to send and receive text messages (SMS). making this module an excellent solution for any project that needs long-range connectivity.
 
Now, insert the SIM card into the back of the SIM800 module. Then, attach the SIM800 TX and RX to the Arduino D8 and D7 respectively. These are the serial UART connections that allow communication between the two modules.
If the power to the SIM800L is enough, the onboard LED starts blinking. If there’s not enough power, the LED blinks for almost three seconds and then turns off.
Here is the full sketch for the AT command test:
#include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;
SoftwareSerial sim800l(2,3);
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
sim800l.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
while (Serial.available()) {
delay(1);
sim800l.write(Serial.read());
}
while (sim800l.available()) {
Serial.write(sim800l.read());
}
}
Test Code
#include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;
String Arsp, Grsp;
SoftwareSerial gsm(2, 3); // RX, TX
void setup() {
// put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("Testing GSM SIM800L");
gsm.begin(4800);
}
void loop() {
// put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
if(gsm.available())
{
Grsp = gsm.readString();
Serial.println(Grsp);
}
if(Serial.available())
{
Arsp = Serial.readString();
gsm.println(Arsp);
}
}
Once you upload the code to the Arduino board, you’ll be able to send all the AT commands in order to send/receive text messages or make calls.
The FONA library is a library for interfacing with the SIM800 module. It allows you to send and receive SMS messages, make and receive calls, and connect to the internet. The SIM800 FONA library is open source and is released under the MIT license. The SIM800 FONA library is easy to use and is well documented. I would recommend this library to anyone looking for an easy way to interface with the SIM800 module.
The library I recommend is Adafruit’s FONA library you can go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries and type “FONA” in the search bar.
Download the source and click the library:
•	Library SIM800L: Adafruit FONA
The library comes with a number of examples. The FONA_test sketch provides us access to all the SIM800l functions! If you upload the sketch and use the same wiring diagram.
The FONA library owns a simple send SMS() function that takes the number and message as parameters and returns true if the message was sent through the network successfully. Here’s an example code that sends one SMS:
Now we will make code the Arduino mega to send a message to the local people near the device to warn them of elephant sightings.
#include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;
#include "Adafruit_FONA.h"
#define FONA_RX 2
#define FONA_TX 3
#define FONA_RST 4
char replybuffer[255];
SoftwareSerial sim800l = SoftwareSerial(FONA_TX, FONA_RX);
Adafruit_FONA gsm = Adafruit_FONA(FONA_RST);
//uint8_t readline(char *buff, uint8_t maxbuff, uint16_t timeout = 0);
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
sim800l.begin(9600);
if (! gsm.begin(sim800l)) {
Serial.println(F("Couldn't find SIM800L!"));
while (1);
}
char sendto[21] = "*********"; //give the phone number
char message[141] = "Alert!!!
                    Elephant spotted at Node x
                    Place"; // replace the x and place with node number and installed place
gsm.sendSMS(sendto, message);
delay(1000);
}
void loop() {}
 
Data monitoring and logging using NodeRed from Master
A Master will be collecting the information from all the deployed nodes and sending the data to the base station so that the authorities can monitor elephant spotting and the data can be used to analyze the elephant sighting pattern and behaviours so that we can make the solution more efficient and bring in necessary changes and take better actions to avoid elephant-human conflicts and for a better co-existence
Now lets setup Node-red :
1.Install Node.js
Download the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official Node.js home page. It will offer you the best version for your system.
Run the downloaded MSI file. Installing Node.js requires local administrator rights; if you are not a local administrator, you will be prompted for an administrator password on install. Accept the defaults when installing. After installation completes, close any open command prompts and re-open to ensure new environment variables are picked up.
while installing make sure to tick this box
Once installed, open a command prompt and run the following command to ensure Node.js and npm are installed correctly.
Using Powershell: node --version; npm --version
Using cmd: node --version && npm --version
You should receive back output that looks similar to:
v18.15.0

9.5.0
2. Install Node-RED
Installing Node-RED as a global module adds the command node-red to your system path. Execute the following at the command prompt:
npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
3. Run Node-RED
Once installed, you are ready to run Node-RED
Then open your comment prompt and type
node-red
It will show the initialization of the Node-red in the cmd
 
from there copy the http://127.0.0.1:1880/
and paste it into chrome browser
and this workspace will open up
 
After that workspace has opened up we need something called the node-red-dashboard
inorder to install it :
click on the three bars you see on the top right and then click on manage palette and then go to install section and paste "node-red-dashboard" there and install it
the window will look like this :
 
Now we can start setting up the flow in node-red and we will show the data in a table in the dashboard where we can monitor and log the data of elephant sighting from the nodes with the date, time and location
 
The EleTect dashboard will look like this.

Demonstration










Scalability of the Project
1) Modular Design:TinyML-enabled nodes enable quick deployment over large elephant corridors. According to a 2021 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) study, TinyML and other modular technology are especially well-suited for wildlife conservation applications because of their low infrastructure requirements and simplicity of scalability.
2) Range Adjustment: Depending on the length of the forest boundary is, the system can be scaled up or down by adding or removing nodes. Elephant migration patterns were used to determine the optimal node density for cost-effectiveness, as shown by a 2023 deployment in Kenya's Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy.
3) Habitat Diversity: Eletect isn't just for certain kinds of forests. A 2022 study that was published in the journal Ecological Applications discovered that elephants in different African and Asian settings showed aversion to bee noises, indicating the deterrent's universality.
4) Integration with Existing Systems: The LoRa or LoRaWAN communication technology can potentially integrate with existing wildlife monitoring systems, enhancing overall effectiveness.
5) Anti-Poaching:
● Early Warning Systems: Rangers might be informed of any poaching activities by nodes equipped with acoustic sensors, which could pick up strange sounds or gunshots. African savanna anti-poaching operations were greatly enhanced by acoustic monitoring equipment, according to a 2022 study published in Global Ecology and Conservation.
● Tracking Animals: By combining TinyML with GPS, rangers may be able to track endangered animals in real time, keeping an eye on their whereabouts and discouraging poaching. A 2023 pilot study in Nepal proved how well a device like this is in tracking rhinos.
6) Military Applications:
● Perimeter Security: Unauthorized incursions near borders or sensitive military sites may be detected by nodes. TinyML-based acoustic monitoring systems fared well in perimeter security applications, according to a 2021 study published in Sensors.
● Early Warning for Explosives: By adding more sensors, the system might be able to identify the acoustic characteristic of IEDs, which would provide important early warnings. Current research in this field shows encouraging findings from a 2022 study published in the journal PLOS One.
7) Natural Disaster Detection: Nodes with additional sensors can detect changes in air pressure, humidity, or seismic activity, providing early warnings for natural disasters like floods or landslides. A 2020 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) highlights the importance of low-cost, scalable sensor networks for disaster risk reduction.

Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to sustainability, "EleTect" embodies the potential of technology to address complex environmental challenges and foster harmonious relationships between humans and wildlife.

💡 Inspiration

WhatsApp Image 2025-08-02 at 11.08.23_dbb6f773.jpg

In the dense forests and mountainous regions of Kerala, especially areas like Nelliampathy, wild elephants frequently traverse routes that have been part of their migratory patterns for centuries. These pathways, known locally as “Aanathaara” (elephant corridors), are deeply embedded in the landscape and ecology. However, with rapid human expansion — including roads, farmlands, and settlements — these natural trails now intersect with human activity, often with devastating consequences.

While locals may instinctively understand where and when to be cautious, most visitors, tourists, and even daily commuters remain unaware of the risks.In early 2025, a tragic incident occurred in Nelliampathy, Kerala. A German tourist, unfamiliar with the terrain and unaware of a wild elephant blocking the road, ventured forward despite the locals’ warnings. Tragically, he encountered the elephant and lost his life. Traditional static signage, such as painted boards warning of elephants, often fades into the background and fails to provide real-time, actionable alerts. The result? Dangerous — and sometimes fatal — encounters that could have been avoided with better awareness.



That's where EleTect 1.5 comes in — combining TinyML, LoRa, solar power, and interactive signage to proactively warn and deter.

🛠️ What It Does

EleTect 1.5 is an advanced extension of the award winning EleTect 1.0 system. It introduces an interactive digital signage system that provides real-time warnings to riders and drivers when elephants are present ahead on forest roads.

🐘 EleTect Node (Detection Unit)

Detects elephants using a TinyML-powered system which can identify an elephant using vision and sound.

Uses LoRa to send elephant presence status to the signage node.

Triggers a deterrent mechanism (e.g., honeybee sound) only when vehicles are present.

🚦 Signage Node (Warning System)

Placed 500m before known elephant crossings.

Displays a bright, red, flashing elephant warning.

Integrated camera detects the presence of vehicles.

Sends vehicle presence data to EleTect Node.

All powered entirely by solar energy.

🔁 Workflow

Elephant detected ➡️ EleTect Node triggers LoRa alert to Sign Board.

Signboard flashes elephant warning if vehicles are approaching.

Signboard checks for vehicles using camera:

If vehicles are detected → message sent to EleTect Node.

EleTect Node waits 10 minutes → plays deterrent bee sound.

After elephants leave, detection stops → Signboard resets.

🐘 What is Eletect?

image.png

Eletect is a technology-driven system designed to detect elephants early, deter them harmlessly, and alert nearby communities. Its goal is to protect lives, foster coexistence, and contribute to wildlife conservation.

Despite their size and power, elephants have a surprising vulnerability: they are instinctively afraid of bee buzzing sounds. By carefully and harmlessly using this natural deterrent, Eletect can safely redirect elephants away from human settlements without harming them. This peaceful strategy respects both humans and elephants.

⚠️ Disclaimer

Before continuing with this tutorial, please make sure you have read the complete EleTect documentation.
The first part—which covers building the Detection + Deterrence Node—is fully explained there and not repeated here to avoid making this documentation unnecessarily long.

This guide should be considered as a continuation of the original EleTect documentation.

👉 Click here to read the full EleTect documentation.

⚙️ How it Works

At the forest boundaries, multiple TinyML-powered nodes are deployed. Each node can:

Detect elephants using a vision-based TinyML model on the Seeed Studio Grove Vision AI V2 module.

Analyze sound using a Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense, running a TinyML audio model to detect elephant vocalizations.

Trigger deterrents by playing honeybee buzzing sounds through an onboard speaker.

Communicate via LoRa/LoRaWAN with a central master node to ensure real-time updates even in remote areas.









The system is completely solar-powered, making it sustainable and ideal for deployment in remote forest region

🌿 Field Survey, Official Approval & Real-World Trials

To ensure EleTect was not just a lab prototype but a real-world conservation tool, our team carried out an extensive ground survey and obtained official permission for field testing from the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) of Kothamangalam, Mr. Varun Dalia, IFS, and Forest Range Officer, Mr. Jaleel.

🧭 On-Ground Survey & Study Area

The field research took place in Kothamangalam and Kottapady, Kerala — regions at the edge of the Western Ghats that experience frequent elephant incursions into farmlands and villages.

We conducted household-level surveys to assess the scale and nature of human–elephant conflict (HEC) in these areas. From 100 surveyed households, 85 reported direct encounters with elephants, while:

66% suffered crop destruction, and

38.4% experienced human injury or fatalities related to elephant incidents.

Screenshot 2025-10-06 144258.png
 

This data emphasized the urgent need for early warning and deterrent systems like EleTect.

🏛️ Collaboration & Forest Department Approval

After the survey phase, we formally presented EleTect to the DFO Office, Kothamangalam, and Forest Range Office to discuss its technical operation, safety, and ecological compatibility.

Screenshot 2025-10-06 144348.png



Following evaluation, the Forest Department granted permission to conduct live field trials in designated forest-border regions.

This collaboration provided both ethical validation and administrative support, ensuring that EleTect aligns with wildlife protection policies and sustainable forest management goals.

🏆 IEEE IAS CMD Humanitarian Award 2025



We are proud to share that EleTect was awarded the IEEE IAS CMD Humanitarian Project Award for the year 2025, in recognition of its innovative, impactful, and humanitarian approach to addressing the growing crisis of human–elephant conflict. As lives continue to be lost in forest-border regions, our team proposed a non-lethal, intelligent, and community-centered solution that fuses traditional tribal practices—such as the use of honeybee deterrents—with modern TinyML and edge AI technologies. EleTect demonstrates how technology can honor ecological wisdom while enhancing safety and peaceful coexistence.
 



As part of this recognition, we were invited to present EleTect at the IEEE IAS Annual Meeting 2025 in Taiwan, where we showcased the system’s design, field deployments, and real-world impact to an international audience of researchers and engineers. The smart signage module, developed under EleTect 1.5, is a functional extension of the project, aimed at solving additional dimensions of the problem—including early detection, deterrence, communication, and public awareness.

🛠️ Step 1: Build the Custom Signage Enclosure

In this step, we’ll create a weatherproof and visually impactful enclosure that houses the electronics for the elephant warning signage system. The enclosure is made from 5mm clear acrylic sheets, designed in Fusion 360, and laser cut for precision.

🧰 Materials Needed

5mm thick clear acrylic sheet

Access to a laser cutter

Acrylic glue (e.g., Weld-On 3 or Fevikwik)

Vinyl cutter and precision knife

Reflective vinyl sticker sheet (yellow and red)

Matte black vinyl sheet

Clamps or tape for alignment

Fusion 360 or similar CAD software

Cooling film

🖥️ Step 1.1: Design the Enclosure in Fusion 360

Create a Design in Fusion360 for the enclosure.

IMG-20250802-WA0012.jpg

Sketch the front panel dimensions based on your component layout (camera, LEDs, LoRa antenna, etc.).Ensure the box has enough depth to house the electronics.

IMG-20250802-WA0037.jpg

IMG-20250802-WA0043.jpg

Export each face of the enclosure as a DXF file for laser cutting.

image.png

🔥 Step 1.2: Laser Cut the Acrylic Panels

Upload the DXF files to your laser cutter’s software.

Set your laser cutter to the appropriate power/speed settings for 5mm acrylic.

Carefully cut each panel and label them as you go to avoid confusion during assembly.Peel off any protective film after cutting.

👉 Safety first! Wear proper eye protection and operate the cutter in a ventilated area.

IMG-20250802-WA0013.jpg






 

IMG-20250802-WA0015.jpg

🧷 Step 1.3: Assemble the Enclosure

Lay out all the cut pieces on a clean surface.

IMG-20250802-WA0032.jpg

Begin with the base and edges.Apply acrylic glue along the joining edges and press pieces together.Use clamps or masking tape to hold parts in place until dry.





Continue assembling all sides until the box is complete.

IMG-20250802-WA0045.jpg

Let the entire assembly cure for several hours to ensure strong bonding.

👉 Tip: Double-check the alignment before applying glue — acrylic bonds instantly!Grind and smoothen the irregular edges using a grinding tool.



✨ Step 1.4: Apply the Reflective Graphics

Design an elephant silhouette and the text “ELEPHANTS AHEAD” using vector software (e.g., Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape).

IMG-20250802-WA0036.jpg

Cut the design using a vinyl cutter from reflective vinyl sheet.

Clean the front acrylic panel with a microfiber cloth.Carefully transfer the reflective vinyl design onto the panel using transfer tape.

IMG-20250802-WA0016.jpg

IMG-20250802-WA0031.jpg

Cover the remaining  back and side edges with matte black vinyl to block internal components and focus attention on the warning.

👉 Result: A bold, reflective front that is highly visible when headlights or onboard LEDs shine on it.

💡 Step 2: Building the Custom LED Panel

In this step, we’ll design and assemble a high-visibility LED panel in the shape of an elephant, mounted inside our previously built acrylic enclosure. This panel serves as a visual alert, visible from a distance even in low-light conditions.

🧰 Materials Required

IMG-20250802-WA0055.jpg

IMG-20250802-WA0053.jpg

4x generic dotted PCBs (perforated board)

400x 5mm Red Clear LEDs

200x 68Ω resistors

22 AWG hookup wire

Soldering iron + solder wire

Black matte spray paint (optional, for aesthetics)

1x N-channel MOSFET (e.g., IRLZ44N)

1x 220Ω resistor (for MOSFET gate)

1x Custom 3S3P LiPo battery pack (11.1V nominal)

Heat shrink, glue, basic tools

🎨 Step 2.1: Prep and Paint the PCBs

Take your four dotted PCBs paint them with matte black paint — this step is optional but gives a professional look and improves contrast against the red LEDs.

IMG-20250802-WA0014.jpg

Let them dry completely.

👉 Tip: Paste a sheet or paper on the back of the pcb before painting so that the paint won't get into the backside✂️ Step 2.2: Join the PCBs to Form a Large Panel

Measure and cut the boards to your desired dimensions.

IMG-20250802-WA0023.jpg

Carefully align and glue the four PCBs together to create a larger panel.

IMG-20250802-WA0042.jpg

IMG-20250802-WA0046.jpg



Make sure all the solder pads align properly and the board is flat.

🐘 Step 2.3: Trace and Plan the LED Layout

Place the vinyl elephant signage or sticker over the panel as a reference.Using a white marker or chalk, roughly trace the outline of the elephant and the text “ELEPHANTS AHEAD”.

IMG-20250802-WA0056.jpg

Plan the LED positions inside this trace to match the shape as closely as possible

👉 Tip: Leave a bit of spacing between each LED to avoid overcrowding.

🔗 Step 2.4: LED Chain Design

We’ll use a simple and efficient wiring scheme:

2 LEDs in series + 1 resistor (68Ω) = 1 chain

Multiple such chains are wired in parallel across the panel

image.png

Why this config?With a 3S (11.1V) LiPo battery, 2 red LEDs (approx. 2V each) + 68Ω resistor draws safe current and provides balanced brightness.

🧪 Step 2.5: Prototype and Test the LED Circuit

First, build one LED chain on a breadboard.

Power it using a bench power supply.

IMG-20250802-WA0017.jpg

IMG-20250802-WA0020.jpg





Confirm brightness and measure current draw.Once satisfied, continue soldering the full design onto the board.

🔩 Step 2.6: Solder All LED Chains

Start from the top of the board, following your traced outline.

IMG-20250802-WA0025.jpg

Insert 2 LEDs in series and connect the 68Ω resistor to complete the chain.Continue placing and soldering LED chains across the board, following your elephant outline and text.

IMG-20250802-WA0029.jpg

Use thin wires to connect common positive and negative rails at the back.

After soldering, check for shorts and test small sections individually.

⚡ Step 2.7: Power and Drive Circuit

Connect all the negative lines from each LED chain to a MOSFET drain.Connect the MOSFET source to ground.Use a 220Ω resistor on the MOSFET gate and connect it to your microcontroller’s digital output (for PWM or ON/OFF control).The positive rail of all LED chains goes directly to the power supply.



Check heat levels and ensure no resistors or LEDs are overheating.

✅ Final Testing

Securely mount the pack inside the enclosure and wire it to the LED panel via a toggle switch or microcontroller control..Turn on the system and ensure all LEDs light up in the correct pattern.

IMG-20250802-WA0018.jpg



But unfortunately, it didn’t quite meet my expectations. During the first test, I wasn’t fully satisfied, as it didn’t look as refined or close to the vision I had in mind.

giphy.gif

But then I had a small idea — if I could diffuse the LED light, it might look much cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing. To quickly test this, I placed a simple A4 sheet between the front acrylic panel and the LED panel.



After diffusing it with an A4 sheet, the display looked even better—cleaner and clearer. There were some dead LEDs ,so i replaced them and it worked perfect.

minions-the-rise-of-gru-bob-smiling-5gar7g2sgrl7d5wx.gif

Initially, my idea was to keep the elephant silhouette completely black when the sign was inactive and then illuminate it in red once activated. To match this concept, I painted the PCB black so that the LEDs would remain invisible until turned on. However, when I tried adding a simple A4 sheet as a diffuser, it disrupted the clean aesthetic I was aiming for, as the sheet made the panel look less appealing.

To tackle this, I thought of using smoked acrylic. This material would give the panel a sleek black look when off, while still allowing the red LEDs to shine through when active. Pairing it with a thin frosted acrylic sheet underneath would help diffuse the light evenly, achieving both functionality and the desired aesthetics.

The challenge, however, was that smoked acrylic was not easily available at the time, and even if sourced, it would add to the cost and overall weight of the system. To find a more practical alternative, I came up with the idea of applying car window cooling film to the back of the front panel to replicate the smoked effect. For light diffusion, I could then use a lightweight and low-cost option like a thin plastic sheet or even butter paper. This way, I could preserve both the aesthetics and the functionality without compromising on budget or weight. Firstly apply the cooling film on the back of the front acrylic panel.

WhatsApp Image 2025-08-21 at 10.41.58_9c101382.jpg

Then use a thin plastic sheet or butter paper to diffuse the light on top of that.

WhatsApp Image 2025-08-21 at 10.42.26_d8901155.jpg

So to test it i quickly made a setup and tested it.



Finally, after several trials, I was able to achieve exactly the result I had envisioned: a signage system that remains sleek and minimal when inactive, but transforms into a striking, attention-grabbing warning when activated.

🧩 How It Works in the EleTect Signage System

Mounted Inside the Smart Signage Unit
The ESP32-C6 board is installed inside our custom enclosure along with the  display, and power circuitry. It acts as the main controller and communication bridge.

Grove Vision AI Integration
The Grove Vision AI V2 module is connected via UART to the ESP32-C6. The Grove module runs its own on-device model to detect vehicles waiting near signage. It sends inference results (e.g. “vehicle detected”) to the C6 board via serial messages.

Data Fusion & Decision Logic
The ESP32-C6 receives elephant presence alerts from EleTect edge nodes via LoRa, and vehicle presence inferences from the camera. Based on these inputs, it decides whether to:Send alert to node to play the honeybee deterrent sound

Trigger LED display of smart signage

Log or escalate to forest officials (optional future SIM module)

LoRa Communication
An external LoRa module connects via SPI/UART. The C6 board listens for LoRa packets from the field-deployed acoustic EleTect nodes. When an elephant alert is received, it stores the event and coordinates camera-based checks before responding.

Signage & Deterrent ControlThe ESP32-C6 controls a DFPlayer Mini  speaker to play honeybee buzz sounds.

It drives an RED LED Panel  for visual alerts to oncoming drivers using MOSFET Drive.

GPIOs control any future add-ons (like floodlights ).

Power & Deployment
The board runs on 5V via USB-C or DC input and is designed for outdoor enclosure integration. It’s lightweight, low-power, and ideal for long-term signage deployment.






Custom model using google collab and Roboflow

image.png

In this part, we'll kick off by labeling our dataset with the intuitive tools provided by Roboflow. From there, we'll advance to training our model within Google Colab's collaborative environment. Next up, we'll explore deploying our trained model using the SenseCraft Model Assistant, a process designed to smoothly bridge the gap between training and real-world applications. By the conclusion of this part, you'll have your very own custom model ready to detect vehicles, operational on Grove Vision AI V2.

From dataset to model deployment, our journey consists of the following key stages:

1. Dataset Labeling — This section details the process of acquiring datasets suitable for training models. There are two primary methods: utilizing labeled datasets from the Roboflow community or curating your own dataset with scenario-specific images, necessitating manual labeling.

2. Model Training with Google Colab — Here, we focus on training a model capable of deployment on Grove Vision AI V2, leveraging the dataset obtained in the previous step via the Google Colab platform.

3. Model Upload via SenseCraft Model Assistant — This segment explains how to employ the exported model file to upload our elephant detection model to Grove Vision AI V2 using the SenseCraft Model Assistant.

Step 1.Create a free Roboflow account

image.png

Roboflow provides everything you need to label, train, and deploy computer vision solutions. To get started, create a free Roboflow account.

Step 2. Creating a New Project and Uploading images

image.png

Once you've logged into Roboflow, Click on Create Project.\

Name your project ("EleTect 1.5"). Define your project as t as Object Detection. Set the Output Labels as Categorical

Now it's time to upload vehicle images.

Collect images of elephants. Ensure you have a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions. On your project page, click "Add Images".

You can drag and drop your images or select them from your computer. Upload at least 100 images for a robust dataset.

click on Save and Continue

Step 3: Annotating Images

After uploading, you'll need to annotate the images by labeling vehicle.

Roboflow offers three different ways of labelling images: Auto Label, Roboflow Labeling and Manual Labeling.

image.png

Auto Label: Use a large generalized model to automatically label images.

Roboflow Labeling: Work with a professional team of human labelers. No minimum volumes. No upfront commitments. Bounding Box annotations start at $0.04 and Polygon annotations start at $0.08.

Manual Labeling: You and your team label your own images.

The following describes the most commonly used method of manual labelling.

Click on "Manual Labeling" button. Roboflow will load the annotation interface.

Select the "Start Annotating" button. Draw bounding boxes around the vehicle in each image.

Label each bounding box as vehicle.

Use the ">" button to move through your dataset, repeating the annotation process for each image.

Step 4: Review and Edit Annotations

It's essential to ensure annotations are accurate.

Review each image to make sure the bounding boxes are correctly drawn and labeled. If you find any mistakes, select the annotation to adjust the bounding box or change the label.

Step 5: Generating and Exporting the Dataset

Once all images are annotated. In Annotate click the Add x images to Dataset button in the top right corner.

Then click the Add Images button at the bottom of the new pop-up window.

Click Generate in the left toolbar and click Continue in the third Preprocessing step.

In the Augmentation in step 4, select Mosaic, which increases generalisation.

image.png

image.png

In the final Create step, please calculate the number of images reasonably according to Roboflow's boost; in general, the more images you have, the longer it takes to train the model. However, the more pictures you have will not necessarily make the model more accurate, it mainly depends on whether the dataset is good enough or not.

Click on Create to create a version of your dataset. Roboflow will process the images and annotations, creating a versioned dataset. After the dataset is generated, click Export Dataset. Choose the COCO format that matches the requirements of the model you'll be training.

image.png

Click on Continue and you'll then get the Raw URL for this model. Keep it, we'll use the link in the model training step a bit later.

Congratulations! You have successfully used Roboflow to upload, annotate, and export a dataset for elephant detection model. With your dataset ready, you can proceed to train a machine learning model using platforms like Google Colab.

Training Dataset Exported Model ​

Step 1. Access the Colab Notebook​

You can find different kinds of model Google Colab code files on the SenseCraft Model Assistant's Wiki. If you don't know which code you should choose, you can choose any one of them, depending on the class of your model (object detection or image classification).

image.png

If you are not already signed into your Google account, please sign in to access the full functionalities of Google Colab.

Click on "Connect" to allocate resources for your Colab session.

image.png

select the panel showing RAM and Disk

image.png

select "Change runtime type"

image.png

Select "T4 GPU"

image.png

Now run the "Setup SSCMA"

image.png

you will get a warning like this click on "Run anyways"

image.png

Wait untill the repositary is fully clonedand installed all the dependencies.

image.png

now its finished

Now run the "download the pretrain model weights file

image.png

Step 2. Add your Roboflow Dataset​

Before officially running the code block step-by-step, we need to modify the code's content so that the code can use the dataset we prepared. We have to provide a URL to download the dataset directly into the Colab filesystem.

To customize this code for your own model link from Roboflow:

1)Replace Gesture_Detection_Swift-YOLO_192 with the desired directory name where you want to store your dataset.

2)Replace the Roboflow dataset URL (https://universe.roboflow.com/ds/xaMM3ZTeWy?key=5bznPZyI0t)

with the link to your exported dataset (It's the Raw URL we got in the last step in Labelled Datasets). Make sure to include the key parameter if required for access.

3)Adjust the output filename in the wget command if necessary

(-O your_directory/your_filename.zip).4)Make sure the output directory in the unzip command matches the directory you created and the filename matches the one you set in the wget command.

Step 3. Adjustment of model parameters​

The next step is to adjust the input parameters of the model. Please jump to the Train a model with SSCMA section and you will see the following code snippet.

This command is used to start the training process of a machine learning model, specifically a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, using the SSCMA (Seeed Studio SenseCraft Model Assistant) framework.

To customize this command for your own training, you would:

1)Replace configs/swift_yolo/swift_yolo_tiny_1xb16_300e_coco.py with the path to your own configuration file if you have a custom one.

2)Change work_dir to the directory where you want your training outputs to be saved.

3)Update num_classes to match the number of classes in your own dataset. It depends on the number of tags you have, for example rock, paper, scissors should be three tags.

4)Adjust epochs to the desired number of training epochs for your model. Recommended values are between 50 and 100.

5)Set height and width to match the dimensions of the input images for your model.

6)Change data_root to point to the root directory of your dataset.

7)If you have a different pre-trained model file, update the load_from path accordingly.

image.png



Step 5. Exportthe model​

After training, you can export the model to the format for deployment. SSCMA supports exporting to ONNX, and TensorFlow Lite at present

Step 6. Evaluate the model​

When you get to the Evaluate the model section, you have the option of executing the Evaluate the TFLite INT8 model code block.

Step 6. Download the exported model file​

After the Export the model section, you will get the model files in various formats, which will be stored in the Model Assistant folder by default. Our stored directory is EleTect 1.5.

image.png

select "ModelAssistatnt"

In the directory above, the .tflite model files are available for XIAO ESP32S3 and Grove Vision AI V2. For Grove Vision AI V2, we prefer to use the vela.tflite files, which are accelerated and have better operator support. And due to the limitation of the device memory size, we recommend you to choose INT8 model.

After locating the model files, it's essential to promptly download them to your local computer. Google Colab might clear your storage directory if there's prolonged inactivity. With these steps completed, we now have exported model files compatible with Grove Vision AI V2. Next, let's proceed to deploy the model onto the device.

Upload models to Grove Vision V2 via SenseCraft Model Assistant

Please connect the device after selecting Grove Vision AI V2 and then select Upload Custom AI Model at the bottom of the page.

image.png

You will then need to prepare the name of the model, the model file, and the labels. I want to highlight here how this element of the label ID is determined.

If you are using a custom dataset, then you can view the different categories and its order on the Health Check page. Just install the order entered here.

Then click Send Model in the bottom right corner. This may take about 3 to 5 minutes or so. If all goes well, then you can see the results of your model in the Model Name and Preview windows above.

Click on deploy and connect your grove vision V2.

Press Confirm and you are good to go.


📦 Camera Enclosure Design and Fabrication



To enable reliable visual monitoring in forest-edge and roadside environments, we designed a custom enclosure for the Grove Vision AI V2 Module using Autodesk Fusion 360. This case houses the camera securely and is optimized for outdoor use, with a snug lens window, mounting slots, and environmental protection. The enclosure was 3D printed using PLA filament and tested for hardware alignment and field durability.







The camera system is mounted on top of the smart signage unit, giving it an elevated, unobstructed view of the road ahead. Its primary role is to detect the presence of vehicles near the signage location, enabling dynamic decision-making. If an elephant is detected  and remains in the elephant corridor for a prolonged time—potentially blocking the road—the system uses camera input to verify the presence of halted vehicles. In such cases, it automatically triggers the honeybee deterrent and visual warning mechanisms, encouraging the elephant to move away and clear the path safely.



For field reliability and modular maintenance, the camera module connects to the signage base using aviation-grade connectors, ensuring secure power and signal transmission in harsh outdoor conditions.

Now that we have done training the vision based model, now we can connect it to EleTect node

🧠 Step 4: Connecting the Signboard to EleTect Node

image.png

Now that we have our physical enclosure and the custom LED warning panel ready, it's time to connect the system to the EleTect detection node using LoRa communication.

📡 Communication Architecture:

1.EleTect Node (Forest-side)

Detects elephant presence using:

Grove Vision AI V2 → vision-based elephant detection.

XIAO ESP32S3 Sense → sound-based detection.

On detection → Sends ELEPHANT_DETECTED message via LoRa to the Signboard Node.

If VEHICLE_PRESENT is received back → waits 10 minutes → activates bee sound deterrent via DFPlayer Mini + Speaker.

Sends ELEPHANT_LEFT when elephants leave → resets the system.

2.Signboard Node (Roadside)

Listens for elephant alerts from EleTect Node.

On detection → flashes warning LED (with elephant symbol) continuously until elephant leaves.

Uses Grove Vision AI V2 running a TinyML vehicle detection model to constantly check for vehicles.

If vehicles are detected while elephants are present → sends VEHICLE_PRESENT message to EleTect Node.

Outcome

🚦 Elephant but no vehicles → Only flashing signboard (no sound, less disturbance).

🚦 Elephant + vehicles present → Signboard flashes + EleTect triggers bee sound after 10 minutes.

✅ Once elephant leaves → Signboard turns off, deterrent stops, system resets.

🧰 What You’ll Need:

XIAO ESP32S3 – For LoRa and LED control

LoRa-E5 Grove Module – For receiving data from EleTect node3S3P Li-ion Pack – Custom power solution for high LED current drawMOSFET (e.g., IRF540N or similar) – To drive the LED panel

220Ω Resistor – Gate resistor for the MOSFET

Jumper Wires

🔌 Firmware for the Signboard XIAO ESP32S3:

Here's a basic sketch to control the LED flashing when elephant presence data is received from the EleTect node.

🧾 Code for the Signboard Node (Receiver):

🔋 Powering the System:

The entire signboard is powered by a custom 3S3P battery pack made using Li-ion cells (11.1V ~ 12.6V).And downed using a buck converter to 5V.

The MOSFET allows the microcontroller to switch the high current LED panel without overloading the XIAO.

🧩 Step 5: 3D Printing and Mounting the LED Panel to a Custom Stand

Stand Construction from Scrap Metal

To reduce costs and promote sustainability, the stand for the EleTect warning signage and solar panel was made entirely from scrap metal. Despite being built from repurposed material, it is sturdy, weather-resistant, and highly visible.

Materials Used

1-inch square metal pipe (scrap, reused)

Welding machine (for joints)

Cutting tool (angle grinder)

Anti-rust paint (to protect against corrosion in forest conditions)

Mounting bolts & brackets (for signage + solar panel)

Dimensions & Assembly

Height: ~8 feet (tall enough for clear visibility to drivers).

Pole: Single vertical square pipe serves as the main post.

Base: Welded flat support with angled bracing, bolted into the ground for stability.

Top Section:

Solar panel mounted with a small angled bracket for optimal sunlight.

Warning signage (“Elephants Ahead”) firmly attached just below the panel.

Construction Steps

Cutting the Scrap Pipe: The scrap pipe was cut into one 8 ft piece (main vertical) and smaller pieces for the base support.

Building the Base: A flat base with short stabilizers was welded to the bottom so it could be anchored securely into the ground with bolts.

Mounting the Sign & Solar Panel:

A horizontal bracket at the top holds the solar panel at an angle.

The triangular signage board is bolted slightly below the solar panel.

Painting & Finishing: The entire stand was coated with anti-rust paint, ensuring long durability outdoors.

Benefits

Ultra Low Cost: Made from waste scrap material.

Eco-Friendly: Reuses metal that would otherwise be discarded.

Durable: Strong enough to withstand wind, rain, and wildlife contact.

Scalable: Simple design can be replicated in bulk for multiple forest corridors.

Designing the Mount

To ensure stability and long-term deployment in outdoor environments, we designed a custom 3D printed mount that securely holds the LED signboard and aligns it on the custom metal pipe-based stand.

🛠️ Materials Used:

PLA filament (Black)

3D printerM4 bolts and nutsScrews (for enclosure-mounting)steel pipe (for pole mounting)

🎯 Design Process:

CAD Modeling:

Using Fusion 360 design a mounting bracket that matches the dimensions of the acrylic signboard enclosure

Participating in Maker Faire Shenzhen 2025 helped validate the design, gather feedback from industry experts, and explore possibilities for scaling the EleTect system for real-world deployments.

🌍 Future Plans



One of the most impactful upgrades we are planning for EleTect is the integration of Google Maps into the system. Currently, EleTect is capable of detecting elephant movement and triggering local deterrents or alerts. However, by incorporating Google Maps, we aim to create a real-time, centralized monitoring system that will drastically improve response times and ensure safer coexistence between humans and elephants.

🔹 How It Will Work:

Live Location Mapping – Each EleTect unit deployed in the field will send detection data (timestamp, location coordinates, and event details) to a central cloud server.

Google Maps Visualization – The data will be displayed on Google Maps, showing the exact position of elephant sightings or conflicts in real-time.

Risk Zone Alerts – Areas with frequent detections will be marked as “High Risk” zones, allowing authorities and locals to take precautionary measures.

Community Access – Farmers, drivers, and forest officials will be able to access a live web/app dashboard powered by Google Maps, ensuring they are instantly informed of nearby elephant movement.  Historical Data & Prediction – By overlaying historical data on Google Maps, the system can predict elephant routes and hotspots, helping in long-term conflict mitigation planning.

🔹 Benefits:

Prevent Road Accidents – Drivers will receive live alerts on elephant crossings ahead, reducing the risk of collisions (like the unfortunate German tourist incident).

Safer Agriculture – Farmers can check real-time elephant movement before stepping into their fields at night.

Better Resource Deployment – Forest officials can allocate patrols and deterrents more effectively.

Community Awareness – Local communities gain accessible, visual information, fostering safer human-elephant coexistence.

While designed for mitigating human-elephant conflict, the system can also be adapted for other regions and animals, such as kangaroos, deer, or bison, with only minimal modifications required. The overall goal remains the same: to reduce accidents, save human lives, and protect wildlife.

IMG_4563.jpeg



This integration will make EleTect not just a detection and deterrent system, but a smart, location-aware safety network that can save countless lives – both human and elephant.

🌱 Let’s Save Lives — Humans and Elephants Alike

With EleTect 1.5, we bridge the communication gap between the wild and the road.
Our goal is simple yet powerful: make our forests safer — not by blocking wildlife, but by understanding and respecting their natural paths.

By combining AI, long-range communication, and intelligent alert systems, EleTect aims to reduce human–elephant conflict and create safer environments for both wildlife and people.

We are now looking forward to deploying this system in real-world locations, gathering field data, and continuously improving the platform.
Our hope is to make a genuine impact — protecting wildlife, preventing accidents, and ultimately making people’s lives better.
